The Movie DataBase is a website/school project where you can fetch certain information from a movie API called themoviedb (TMDB) - (https://www.themoviedb.org/)
You can for example choose to view 10 of the top rated movies, 10 of the most popular movies or simply search for a movie/person to see more information about them.

Documentation for the movie API I have used:

Documentation for the library I have used to create the animation for my website:
